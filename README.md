# QE 7.1
紀錄大二第一次參加叢集競賽(ISC23 online)的題目

## 1.Intro
### Quantum Espresso 
An integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.
#### cp.x
A core component of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution.
CP can perform Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, including variable-cell dynamics
#### pw.x  
A set of programs for electronic structure calculations within density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory, using plane wave basis sets and pseudopotentials.
